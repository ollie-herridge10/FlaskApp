# FlaskApp
### This Todo App incorporates Flask and SQLAlchemy where you can Add, Update and Delete your day-to-day tasks.

# Site Goals
### The purpose of this Todo App is to be able to give the user accessability in creating a daily task, then able able to update with completion and then delete if wanted.

# WireFrames
### This was a base wireframe fro my intial idea but I did change my vision slightly as I progressed through the project.
